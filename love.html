    <h2>For My Love ❤️</h2>

    <p>
      Hey my love, my partner, I know today feels heavy and uncomfortable, and I wish I could take all that back and stomach pain away from you. Since I can’t, I want you to know how deeply I love you.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’re allowed to slow down, complain, and rest without being strong for anyone. I see you, I admire you, and I’m so proud of you for simply getting through this time. Share with me what you feel, tell me what you are going through.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please be gentle with yourself. Drink your water, take your time, and let your body do what it needs to do. If I were there with you at this time, I’d warm your hands, rub your back forever, give you back scratches the way you like, give you infinite hugssss and kissess, would cuddle you the whole day and remind you how beautiful you are even when you don’t feel like it.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are my safe place, my favorite thought, and my heart. Pain doesn’t make you less strong or less beautiful; it just reminds me of how brave and strong you are. I’m right here, cheering you on, loving you quietly and loudly, today and always. Close your eyes, breathe slowly, and remember I’m holding you in every heartbeat always.
    </p>
